# Improving Rankings for "Echo Stories" Brand Search

## Current Situation (January 15, 2026)

**Problem:**
- ❌ "Echo Stories" → Not visible even on page 5
- ✅ "Echo Stories Prague" → Top 2 results

**Why this happens:**
"Echo Stories" is a common phrase used by:
- Video games (Echo Stories game)
- Books and novels
- Other media properties
- Generic storytelling content

Your site needs to build stronger **brand authority** to rank without location qualifiers.
