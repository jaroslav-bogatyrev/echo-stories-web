“Can someone from Soviet-era panel housing truly know beauty?”

Yana, a Belarusian immigrant in Prague, once dreamed of becoming an actress but now spends her nights drinking and partying. After five years of failed auditions, she is supposed to start her first office job tomorrow. She borrows a suit from her Ukrainian friend Zoya, fights with Polina, a Belarusian architecture student, and visits Bojan, a Serbian bartender she secretly loves.

When she reaches her apartment door, Yana realizes she has forgotten her keys. This sparks a magical night of alcohol, broken hearts, public-transport mishaps, and even time travel with a local ghost. Can returning to the past she left behind reveal the key to her future?

Yana is a social chameleon who adapts to everyone but cannot find herself. "Kupala Night" uses an episodic, multi-perspective structure: Zoya hides her roots to fit in, Polina avoids her prison trauma, and Bojan literally lives in the past. Together, Yana and her friends represent an emotional reality of a fractured worldview of an immigrant.

Project will be presented at the BIFA pitching event at Berlinale 2026.
