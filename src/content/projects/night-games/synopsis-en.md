The peaceful solitude of Makoshe, an ancient Slavic forest spirit, is disrupted when a Czech summer camp reopens after years of silence. Among the counselors are Anna, a shy first-timer, and her girlfriend Radka, confident, experienced, and admired by both children and staff.

When Anna sees Radka cheating, the shock sends her deep into the woods. There, a darkened hand pulls her into the swamp.

Anna eventually returns, but something inside her has changed. Entwined with Makoshe, she struggles to hold onto herself as the boundary between personal heartbreak and mythical anger grows increasingly thin. As the highlight of the holidays the Makoshe celebration starts in the camp and the biggest attraction, the night games, begin.

When children go into the dark woods to confront fear all the tension erupts into a violent confrontation. One that Anna cannot walk away from. At dawn, she is claimed by the forest, and Makoshe finds a new host: an eleven-year old Betka.
